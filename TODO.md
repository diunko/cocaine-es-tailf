### TODO

* add config support
  It would be nice to specify options in some kind of config, and not
  on command-line
* add more query options
* allow querying of past intervals, not just `tail -f` behavior
* support querying of two-days of indices (this matters on midnight,
  when some of required data is in yesterday's index)
* ???
